how does the graph structure influence the classical ml classifiers?

We consider a directed graph, where nodes = research papers and there is an edge from A to B if A cities B
indegree = how cited a paper is
outdegree = how many papers it cites
labels = topic of research/field of research

"Citation graphs usually form topic clusters"

Some details inferred from the structure:
Some nodes - hubs(survey papers)
Some nodes - isolated(basic work)
Some nodes -  briges(interdisciplinary)

what do you mean by graph structures? 

1.How connected a node is ?(local connectivity) : in degree, outdegree, neighbour count .. answers popular papers vs basic papers
2.Neighbourhood cohesion : are neighbours connected? : clustering coefficient, triangles, : interprets tight clusters vs isolated ones
3.Position in global view(positional importance) : betweenness, closness : interprets : brigdes, peripheral nodes, influential nodes
4.How are my neighbours(structural context) : average neighbor count, neighbour centrality, interprets : papers citing strong vs weak works

centrality - how important a node is in the graph
degree, clustering , centrality( degree, betweeness(bridge)(captures how many shortest paths pass through this), closeness(captures average distance to others), eigen vector(checks if its neighbours themselves are important))

key note : "nodes are not independent" the features of one node may depend on the other
Build features(rows)
each row represents : indegree, outdegree, clusturing coeffiecient, local triangle count, betweeness, centrality, label

“Naive Bayes reveals how feature dependence affects learning, while Softmax shows how relaxing this assumption changes performance.”
Naive Bayes is not a competitor to Softmax Regression in this project; it is a lens to study how graph-induced feature dependence affects classical classifiers.
